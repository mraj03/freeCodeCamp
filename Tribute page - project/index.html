            <h3>Here's a recounting of key moments in Jobs' life.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>1955:</strong> Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and
                    Abdulfattah Jandali.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1961:</strong> The Jobs family moves to Mountain View, Calif., part of what would later
                    become known as Silicon Valley.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1968:</strong> Jobs calls Bill Hewlett, the co-founder and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard,
                    looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter. Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an
                    internship with the company that summer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1970:</strong> Meets future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak through a friend. In Wozniak's
                    2006 autobiography, "iWoz," he notes that the two "hit it off" immediately, despite their four-year
                    age difference.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1976:</strong> Co-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. That same year, the
                    company sells the Apple I in the form of a kit that sells for $666.66.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1977:</strong> Apple incorporates.

                    <strong>1977:</strong> Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and
                    Abdulfattah Jandali.

                    <strong>1980:</strong> Apple goes public, putting Jobs' net worth north of $200 million.

                <li>
                    <strong>1985:</strong> CEO John Sculley engineers Jobs' ouster from Apple. Jobs resigns as Apple
                    chairman, saying in a board meeting, "I've been thinking a lot, and it's time for me to get on with
                    my life. It's obvious that I've got to do something. I'm 30 years old." Soon thereafter, Jobs starts
                    NeXT Computer (which later becomes NeXT Software), funded by selling $70 million of his Apple stock.
                    An "interpersonal" NeXT workstation, sporting a built-in Ethernet port, is used by Tim Berners-Lee
                    at CERN to become the first server of the World Wide Web.

                    Pixar Animation Studios.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1996:</strong> Returns to Apple, as an adviser, after it buys NeXT for $429 million.
                </li>

                    <strong>1997:</strong> Becomes CEO, initially as the de facto chief, then as interim chief in

            <blockquote>
                I was introduced to the world of Apple when I got my first iPod classic. Now I own a complete line up of
                iPods plus a Mac. I remember when you said, "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.
                Design is how it works." It's the best description for your products. Steve, you have a holistic impact
                on me; you will forever be remembered.
